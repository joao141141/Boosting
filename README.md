# Boosting

In this project, we will be using a dataset containing census information from UCI’s Machine Learning Repository.

By using this census data with boosting algorithms, we will try to predict whether or not a person makes more than $50,000.

Let’s get started!

The original data set is available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income
